Tic Tac Toe Game
Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks (either "X" or "O") horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

How to Play
Open the game in your web browser.
The first player will be "X" and the second player will be "O".
Players take turns clicking on an empty cell in the grid to place their mark.
The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all cells are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
